# Getting and Cleaning Data

This repository contains the course project for the Coursera course "Getting and Cleaning Data", 
by the Johns Hopkins University

Files in the repository:
 * HARUS.csv : Tidy data set on Human Activity Recognition Using Smartphones 
 * run_analysis.r: R scripts that generates a tidy set of data from the raw data
 * CodeBook.md: Code book for the tidy data set
 
The run_analisys.r script generates the tidy set HARUS.csv as long as the source data (see CodeBook) is in the working directory. It is implemented in R and requires de  "dplyr" package.
The CodeBook.md file provides detailed information for the generation of the tidy data set.
